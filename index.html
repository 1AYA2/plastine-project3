                        The importance of the city of Bethlehem to Christians comes because of the birth of Christ, Jesus, son of Mary, in it. There are a number of churches in it, such as the Church of the Nativity, which is one of the oldest churches in the whole world, and which was built by Constantine the Great in 330 AD on a cave that Christians consider The place of the birth of Jesus Christ. Near this church there is a crypt around which there are many beliefs that it is the place where Jerome spent thirty years of his life translating the Holy Bible for Christians.</p>
